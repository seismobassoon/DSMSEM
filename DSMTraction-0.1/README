#1  go to programs and make three programs (TraFFT, TraPSV, TraSH)


#2 programs will be made in the DSMTraction directory

#3 necessary infos are *.psv.model, coordinates.inf, inputIASP.infTra

#4 first you should run TraPSV/SH like

TraPSV < infos/input.infTra
TraSH < infos/input.infTra

# as is also written in the sample inputIASP.infTra, you should manually
# make your outputDir and "Stress", "Displacement", "log", and "ascii" inside

you can monitor how the calculation is going timely when you have a look 
at two files "list*" and "calLog" 

Especially "list*" will tell you frequency index which is ready to use for FFT

you can just modify "imax" in your info file for TraFFT

then 

just

TraFFT < infos/input.infTra

then you can see the green* in your ascii directory




# known bugs:
imax should be 4-digit number for TraPSV/SH (I don't know why for this moment)
